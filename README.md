# dictgame

## PROTOTYPE VERSION

`dictgame` is a simple terminal program written in Lua that gives the user
a random word in a chosen language, and four possible translations.
The goal is to select the correct translation of the word. Each time the
user guesses a word right, the score will increase. 

More game modes are planned.
