BUGS:
- 'reverse' game mode has question-answer order wrong
- no real way to 'cancel' or 'quit' game, aside from losing

FEATURES:
- different scoring methods?
	There should be some sort of motivational factor that makes the user not
	want to make mistakes.
	- (currently) score goes up infinitely; game continues until user gives up
	- idea: score goes up infinitely; game stops when user makes a mistake N times
		- grant an extra life every 5-10 words guessed right?
- export to scoreboard
- custom dictionaries inside program? 
- install & uninstall script
- configuration via environmental vars

GRAPHICS:
- finish terminal version
	- maybe some sort of TUI, with simple colors and shapes
- start working on a graphical version (using Tk?)
	- if not Tk, what about a web version?
